The Eagle .brd files can be sent to OSHPark. The Zipped gerber files can be sent to OSH Park for fabrication

The Teensy 4.0, 4.1, and 2.0++ clone are available for purchase.

Teensy 4.0 board, schematic, and zipped Gerber files are called T4p0 and T4p0_cutout. They accept 1mm, 0.8mm, and 0.5mm surface mount FPC connectors.

Teensy 4.1 board, schematic, and zipped Gerber files are called T4p1 and T4p1_cutout. They accept 1mm, 0.8mm, and 0.5mm surface mount FPC connectors.

The T4p1_thruhole board, schematic, and zipped Gerber files are for 1mm or 1.25mm pitch thru hole connectors. 

The Teensy 2.0++ (clone) uses the Keyboard_Scanner_2pp_RevA board, schematic, and zipped Gerber files. This board avoids using the I/O pin tied to the LED. 

The following are useful FPC breakout boards:

FPC_8pin1mm.brd EagleCad file for 8 pin 1mm breakout board

FPC_10pin0p5mm.brd  EagleCad file for 10 pin 0.5mm breakout board

FPC_18pin1mm.brd  EagleCad file for 18 pin 1mm, 0.8mm, or 0.5mm breakout board

The following boards use the Teensy LC and 3.2 which are obsolete and should not be used for new designs. Use the Teensy 4.0, 4.1, and 2.0++ (clone) for new designs.

Keyboard_Scanner.brd EagleCad circuit board file for Teensy LC or 3.2. Original layout shown in the video. The LT2 board is better.

Keyboard_Scanner_LT.brd EagleCad file same as above with 2 bit Level Translator for touchpad Clock and Data on Teensy LC side. The LT2 board is better.

Keyboard_Scanner_LT2.brd EagleCad file same as above with improved hole spacing for using right angle header on Teensy 3.2 backside signals

Keyboard_Scanner_LT_0p5.brd EagleCad file same as above except made for a 0.5mm pitch FPC connector

Keyboard_Scanner_Dual.brd EagleCad file is for keyboards with dual FPC cables but it uses the obsolete Teensy LC and 3.2

Keyboard_Scanner_4p0.brd EagleCad file for Teensy LC or 4.0 with 1mm or 0.8mm pitch. The T4p0.brd is better

Keyboard_Scanner_4p0_0p5.brd EagleCad file for Teensy LC or 4.0 with 1mm or 0.5mm pitch. The T4p0.brd is better

Keyboard_Scanner_LC_thruhole.brd EagleCad file for thru-hole 1mm pitch FPC cables with up to 26 pins. The T4p1_thruhole.brd is better

TeensyLC_1p25.brd EagleCad file for thru-hole 1.25mm pitch FPC cables with up to 26 pins. The T4p1_thruhole.brd is better

Keyboard_Scanner_2pp.brd EagleCad file for Teensy ++2.0. The Keyboard_Scanner_2pp_RevA.brd is better

Teensy3p2Cutout.brd EagleCad file has a cutout for a Teensy 3.2. The T4p0_cutout.brd is better.

Teensy3p2CutoutFlip.brd EagleCad file is the same as above file but it has the cutout on the right side instead of the left side.
