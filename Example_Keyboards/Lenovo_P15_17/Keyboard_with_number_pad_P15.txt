I'm writing this email using your P17 keyboard with the Teensy 4.1 controller on the new circuit board. 
The middle mouse button (as well as the left and right buttons) work normally. 
The keypad keys work as a number pad when the NumLock control key is active (the LED will turn on). 
The backlight works and is turned on and off with Fn and Backspace keys. 
The trackpoint is working and I increased the default response speed. To toggle the trackpoint speed, push Fn and F12. 
I made a low profile USB extension cable so you can move the connector to the side or rear of your case.
