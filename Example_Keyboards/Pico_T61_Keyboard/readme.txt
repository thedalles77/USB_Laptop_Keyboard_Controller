Thinkpad T61 and T420 USB or Bluetooth Keyboard Controller using a Raspberry Pi Pico W 

**************The software for this project is still in development*************************. 
The keyboard was tested with KMK and all keys are working (see KMK folder). 
The TrackPoint was tested with Arduino C code and is also working (see Arduino folder).
Code to combine the keyboard and TrackPoint has not yet been developed.
Code to communicate over Bluetooth has not been developed.
The circuit board file "Pico_T61_Keyboard" in the Eagle_Layout folder will work with all T60 series keyboards.
A different circuit board file named "Pico_T420_Keyboard" in the same folder is used for all T400 series and X200 series keyboards.

See the PDF for all the design information.
